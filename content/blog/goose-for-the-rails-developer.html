                    <code>rails</code> has excellent support for database seeding, migration, creation, and the
                    migrations conceptually fit into the models system nicely.
                    Switching from the framework to standalone tools can leave you a little lost about how to proceed.
                </p>
                <p>Here's some ideas.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="command equivalents">
                <p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>rails uses config/database.yaml for configuration</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <aside>I find it nice to set <code>GOOSE_MIGRATION_DIR</code> to a directory called migrations.
                        </aside>
                        <p>goose is configured by environment variables. There are 3. goose automatically checks the pwd
                            for a .env file and reads it, for convenience.</p>
                        <p>The environment variables are GOOSE_MIGRATON_DIR, GOOSE_DBSTRING and GOOSE_DRIVERS.</p>
                        <p>GOOSE_DRIVER contains the name of a database driver (e.g. postgres); GOOSE_DBSTRING is a db
                            connection string; GOOSE_MIGRATION_DIR is the name of the directory containing your database
                            migrations.</p>
                        <p>Note that setting the GOOSE_DBSTRING and then running a command like
                            <code>goose status</code> will work correctly.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>rake db:create</code></dt>
                    <dd><p>This is a nice-to-have that has no equivalent in goose. I tried to solve this by making the database in my first migration,
                        but that actually gets into weird rabbit holes as you aren't allowed in postgres to make/delete databases inside transaction
                        blocks, and if you use database connection credentials that connect to the database you want to make then you can never drop
                        that database while connected to it.</p>
                        <p>That means it's best to follow rails' example and use a database creation task that's separate from your migrations. It'll 
                            look something like <code>CREATE DATABASE foo</code> (cf. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html)
                        </p>
                    Note that the down part of the migration is not wrapped in a transaction. That's because I'm dropping a database.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>rails generate migration NAME</code></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>The equivalent is <code>goose create NAME go|sql</code> has a couple of details. First, you
                            can make a
                            migration that's either a go file or a sql file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Go migrations give you all the flexibility of a programming language to add conditional
                            logic to your migrations (e.g. checking for whether $MY_PROJECT_ENV is set to dev, for
                            migrations that should only be run in the dev environment).
                            To execute go migrations defined in go requires compiling a custom binary. The main example
                            on github is terse, but https://github.com/pressly/goose/issues/611 will get you to the
                            right process.
                            Note that the migration itself is still written in sql; you just have golang there to help
                            out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The use-case for go migrations in a single binary is that you have all your migrations in
                            one file, making it simpler to e.g. migrate a database inside a container. It's a harder
                            path to get up and running with, but much simpler once it's working.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>goose create NAME sql</code> is more intuitive. You write raw sql in there.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>rake db:migrate</code></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            Run migrations with the command <code>goose up</code>. If you have a custom compiled binary,
                            this works. If you're using sql migrations, it still works!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that go migrations and sql migrations can coexist in the same repository.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>rake db:seed</code></dt>
                    <dd>
                        No built in equivalent, but here's a couple of ideas for equivalent workflows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                write go migrations and test for environment variables or config files that can tell you
                                whether seed data should be applied. This is my preferred workflow.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                if you only want to use sql migrations, you could write a make task that checks for environment variables or config files to see if it's safe to apply seed data, or a shell script or something
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="conclusion">

                    <code>rails</code> sets the gold standard for a batteries-included framework. Switching to collections of specialised tools can be a lot to take in at first; I had to spend half a day getting used to goose and
                    a different way of seeing how database backed websites can be built, but I've been glad that I've done it. Recreating the experience of the integrated rails toolchain from other parts gives me new respect for how 
                    good rails is.

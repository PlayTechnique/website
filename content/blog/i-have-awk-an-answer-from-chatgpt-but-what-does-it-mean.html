                    Getting the right answer is great, but understanding it is better. I don't understand this awk
                    snippet, but we will by the end of this post:
                </p>
                <code>netstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /LISTEN/'</code>
            </section>

            <section id="research">
                <p>
                    The command is intended for BSD userlands; netstat shows us what software is listening or sending on
                    what ports. I only want listeners, so <code>awk</code> filters out...something. ChatGPT wasn't super
                    clear about its reasoning.
                    I started figuring it out by scanning <code>man awk</code>:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><code>NR</code></dt>
                    <dd>The ordinal number of the current record from the start
                        of input. Inside a BEGIN action the value shall be
                        zero. Inside an END action the value shall be the number
                        of the last record processed.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>|| /LISTEN/</code></dt>
                    <dd>OR search for the string LISTEN, a standard string in the netstat output</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    I don't quite understand what <code>NR<3</code> is getting at (quiet, greybeards in the back who already know). Here's my investigation:
                    <code><pre>
; mkdir tmp && cd tmp && touch 1 2 3 
; ls | awk 'NR<3'

1
2

; cd .. && cat Dockerfile| awk 'NR<3'
FROM golang:1.23 AS base

                    </code> 
                </pre>
                Awk is letting through the first couple of lines; apparently a record is a newline terminated unit of info. The awk command as a whole, then, lets through the header for the output from netstat,
                then the actual info I was looking for. Practically, it's a touch nicer than <code> | grep LISTEN</code>, but functionally the same.

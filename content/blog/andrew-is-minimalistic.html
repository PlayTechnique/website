                    <a href="https://github.com/playtechnique/andrew">Andrew</a>'s intentionally a very minimalist web
                    server. I'm aiming it to be one small
                    step above fronting your website with apache or nginx; it takes care of a couple of nice chores but
                    the rest is on you. It builds out links
                    to each page from your index.html, maintains a sitemap, that sort of thing. It doesn't have an
                    opinion on much else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm aiming at an audience interested in <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">small
                        web</a> development. I share the general
                    nostalgia for when web pages all looked like we didn't know what we were doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted a web server that takes care of just a few tedious chores, but otherwise leaves my styling
                    to <i>me</i> to figure out how to do,
                    leaves it to <i>me</i> to figure out what javascript libraries to include (if any). When I used
                    hugo, I did what the framework gave me by
                    default, but with andrew I had to figure out how to manage code highlighting on this site, where
                    each element should go and how it gets there,
                    that sort of hand-tweaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want a hand with maintaining the boilerplate of your website, I have another tool called <a
                        href="https://github.com/playtechnique/templ">templ</a>.
                    Like every other tool called templ, it manages go templates; like Andrew, it's minimalist. It asks
                    you to store templates in a public git repository, then
                    you download that git repository into templ's cache. When you add new templates to your git repo (by
                    using your familiar, everyday text editor and git push-ing them)
                    you can <code>templ -u</code> to download the new templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want, you can download my templates; you can download as many git repositories as you need.
                    <a href="https://github.com/PlayTechnique/templ_templates/blob/main/webpages/article.html">
                        Here's</a> one of my templates, the one I use for writing new html docs in this website. I love
                    keeping my small tools separate from each other.

            <h1>Finding a Free Port in Go</h1>
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>
			I like testing Go HTTP servers by starting a new temporary web server. I usually have 10s-100s of tests, so if these
			tests are to run in parallel then the web servers need to start on random, free ports.
                </p>

		<p>
			I prefer keeping codebases to the standard library, so here's the snippet that tends to get reproduced in my projects.
		</p>
            </section>

	    <section id="approach">
		    <p>
		    	The approach is to first bind to a random open port using the standard library's helper for that. Then retrieve the now-bound port number, close
			the socket listening on the port and hand the port over to our web server.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	This approach does mean there's potential for a race condition between closing the bound port and opening it in the test web server, but every
			engineering approach has drawbacks and this one's no different.
		    </p>
		    <aside>
			    If you don't want to deal with the potential for a race condition, there are other great approaches to testing http server functionality, such as
			    the <code>httptest</code> library.

            <section id="implementation">
                <p>
<pre><code>
import "net"

func newTestServer(t *testing.T) OurCustomServer {
	t.Helper()

	listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", "localhost:0")

	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	freePort := listener.Addr().String()
	listener.Close()

	server := newServer(freePort)

	return server
	
}
</code></pre>
                </p>
            </section>

		    <p>
		   	I like taking some time to write this sort of code out by hand; although ChatGPT can undoubtedly knock this out in seconds, taking the time
		    	to write this down and understand it reminds me that Moving Fastest isn't one of my values. I prefer mastery of fundamentals.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	A lot of our career is spent trying to achieve the next functionality so that $STARTUP has a chance at winning the market. It's nice sometimes
			to take a breath and implement something simple and rock solid.

            <p id="intro">
                I love using <code>p4merge</code> and <code>p4diff</code> with git as my visual debugger; the scrolling
                presentation is just a little smoother than <code>kdiff</code>, Apple's <code>merge</code> tool or the
                stuff
                integrated into the various IDEs.

                    Here's some examples:
                </p>

                Here's side-by-side scrolling:<br />
                <img src="images/p4merge-scroll.gif" alt="a dual pane editor with 2 copies of the same document open, one on left and one on right, with a paragraph
          different. Scrolling shows the two documents stay aligned, but when the different paragraph is reached it moves
          independently, so the common context above and below is aligned but the difference is obvious. The different
          paragraph is highlighted in green.">
            </aside>

            <aside>
                Here's dual-file editing:<br />
                <img src="images/p4merge-file-editing.gif" alt="The same document displayed twice in p4merge, in a left and right pane. I click an edit button which is
         colour coded to be specific to the right pane and a third pane opens on the bottom, and it's editable. As I add
         update the text in the editor, the right pane also receives the update and p4merge highlights the difference.
        Then I click a separate edit button that is colour-coded to be specific to the left pane, which opens in the same
        editor pane and as I update it the left pane is live-edited to show the difference. The difference between both
        documents that I introduced are saved to the file system.">

            <p>
                The official docs tell you that if you want to integrate it with the command line then you have to write
                that
                integration yourself. It's annoying, but I wrote a bad version several years ago

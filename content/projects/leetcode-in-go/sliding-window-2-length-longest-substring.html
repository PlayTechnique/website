                    To get past my <a href="sliding-window-the-easier-examples.html">previous problem</a> understanding sliding windows, I've
                    kept working on them.

                <p>
                    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
                </p>
            </section>

                The puzzle has a strict limit for defining how to proeed: no character can appear more than once. This kind of condition
                being checked repeatedly over the length of an array is asking for sliding windows.
            </p>
            <p>Identifying this was helped by getting this from the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problem-list/sliding-window/">"sliding window"</a>
                section of the leetcode problems.

                Below is the first iteration of the code above. It's not my first version, but you can see the flaw I mentioned in the <a href="sliding-window-the-easier-examples.html">last post</a>,
                that I'm using <code>if</code> to try and show the computer what to do, rather than just telling it the algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, in writing the big comment in there, I started seeing my error. 
            </p>
<pre><code>
// Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
func LengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
    left, length := 0, 0
    lastIndexOfChar := make(map[rune]int)

    for right, char := range s {

        // When there's no repeating characters in the string this always generates an off by one error.
        // Consider it for a run of a string of length 1.
        // On the first test of `if lastIndexOfChar[char] >= left`, that test will always succeed
        // and left is always incremented to 1.
        // From here, lastIndexOfChar is set to the value of right.
        // In the length calculation, 0 - 1 + 1 == 0. That's wrong; we have 1 character without repetition.
        // For a two character string this can't happen.
        if lastIndexOfChar[char] >= left {
            left = lastIndexOfChar[char] + 1
        }

        lastIndexOfChar[char] = right

        length = int(math.Max(float64(length), float64(right)-float64(left)+1))
    }

    return length
}
</code></pre>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <blockquote>Learning is easier when I stop coding and start thinking, and I did that above by trying to explain the code in the comment there.</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I had done that, I saw the failure case clearly and wrote two tests for it: <i>the failure case was any string that didn't contain a repeating character.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Here's the solution I found eventually. You can see in the gif above that I actually found a surprisingly similar piece of code from leetcode's submitted samples; that
                was entirely because I knew I had <i>something</i> wrong but couldn't see it. It turned out I thought I had written <code>for</code> but had actually retained <code>if</code>
                even though I knew that wasn't what was needed.
<code><pre>
func LengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
    left, length := 0, 0
    countOfChars := make(map[rune]int)

    for right, char := range s {
        countOfChars[char]++

        for countOfChars[char] > 1 {
            leftChar := rune(s[left])
            countOfChars[leftChar]--
            left++
        }

        length = max(length, right-left+1)
    }

    return length
}   
</pre></code>

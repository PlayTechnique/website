                    I've never felt confident in passing coding interviews. I <i>write</i> code a lot, but it's not the kind of algorithm-oriented software that
                    businesses are testing software developers for, it's app code not the sort of thing Linus would recognise.

                        You're not a clueless dog banging at the keyboard with no prospects of ever improving. You're a human of tremendous capacity to become good at what you do. Embrace that.

                        The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses - behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights.

                    These are trivially true things.

                    I've bashed my head against leetcode before and gotten discouraged at how <i>hard</i> it is to learn this sort of algorithmic, data-structure-centric way of viewing
                    the world, when all I want to do is have fun with software. But, damn, I'm tired of being a clueless dog, of feeling like I lost the interview before I even joined
                    the zoom call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clich√© we have is that you can grind leetcode to get good at this. So let's start grinding leetcode, like it's a gym. Learn to love the process of taking six months
                    to see noticeable progress.

                    The first set of leetcode problems about arrays and strings are teaching you to march through
                    arrays and strings using the <b>two pointers</b> technique.

// Example 1: Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.
// A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward as backward. That means,
// after reversing it, it is still the same string. For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".s

    // the end of the string
    end := len(target) - 1

    // i begins at the start of the string
    for i := range target {
        // march end and i towards each other, comparing results. Don't prematurely
        // optimise by trying to stop half way into the string, as that is the way of
        // thinking the difference between O(n) and O(n/2) is meaningful.

// return true if there exists a pair of numbers that sum to target, false otherwise.
// This problem is similar to Two Sum. (In Two Sum, the input is not sorted).
// For example, given nums = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15] and target = 13, return true because 4 + 9 = 13.

    // Iterating over the array slightly differently to the previous question, just
    // to explore. The algorithm's trivial, but in brief: try adding the first
    // and last items. If the resulting candidate sum is bigger than the target,
    // the last item must be too big, so reduce it to the next biggest item, and
    // vice-versa for the smallest item.

// JoinTwoSortedArrays is a generic interface to joining two sorted arrays.
// Generic for practice, not because the problem's calling for it particularly.
// Parameters can be any type that satisfies constraints.Ordered.

// // Ordered is a constraint that permits any ordered type: any type
// // that supports the operators < <= >= >.
// This is presently ints, floats, and strings.

    // either left or right. Using a naked `for` as a synonym for `while`
    // actually wasn't habitual before working through these issues, but
    // go's syntactical simplicity is in sight here.

    // to drain the longer one, but we don't know which it is.

// A subsequence of a string is a sequence of characters that can be obtained by
// deleting some (or none) of the characters from the original string, while maintaining
// the relative order of the remaining characters.
// For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.

    // we're golden. I didn't verify whether len(candidate) is re-calculated here: that'd be good to know.

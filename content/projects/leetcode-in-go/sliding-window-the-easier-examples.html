                    Conceptually, this is straightforwards enough, but implementing the examples has repeatedly had something tricky that's stumped me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is practice, practice, practice. So I'm stopping in this problem set and picking sliding window problems from leetcode's list of tagged
                    problems, to get more practice.

<pre><code>
// Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer limit,
// find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less
// than or equal to the limit. 
func FindLongestSubArrayUnderLimit(numbers []int, limit int) int {
    lengthOfLongestSubArray := 0
    left, currentTotal := 0, 0

    // we have a leftmost pointer initialised above; here we initialise a pointer that'll march
    // right. It starts at the same spot as the leftmost pointer.
    for right := range numbers {
        currentTotal += numbers[right]

        // If the total of the sliding window exceeds the limit, start
        // trimming values from the left.
        for currentTotal > limit {
            currentTotal -= numbers[left]
            left++
        }

        lengthOfLongestSubArray = int(math.Max(float64(lengthOfLongestSubArray), float64(right)-float64(left)+1))
    }

    return lengthOfLongestSubArray
}

    This one was neat to figure out. For a slice <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and a limit of <code>2</code>, on the first iteration
     the running total is 1. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The longest subarray is the maximum of either 0, or right - left, which is 1 - 0, which is 1, so the longest subarray we found without
                    blowing the limit is 1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second iteration, currentTotal gets 2 added to it, for a currentTotal of 3. This is higher than our limit of 2, so we delete a value from the leftmost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm works because we're asking a question about the maximum number of elements in a sequential piece of the array; it's cool.

                    This one, I tried and tried. I ended up reading the python example that leetcode provided and using that to get the answer correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question is: You are given a binary string s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0" 
                    and flip it to a "1". What is the length of the longest substring achievable that contains only "1"?
                    For example, given s = "1101100111", the answer is 5. If you perform the flip at index 2, the string becomes 1111100111.
                </p>
<pre><code>
func WhatIsMostSequentialOnesIfYouFlipOneZero(numbers []int) int 
    // numZeroes tracks the number of sequential zeroes we've seen
    // longestSequentialOnes tracks the highest value cur reaches
    // left is the left pointer in the sliding window
    numZeroes, longestSequentialOnes, left := 0, 0, 0

    for right := range numbers {
        val := numbers[right]

        if val == 0 {
            numZeroes++
        }

        // This took me a while to finally understand. The logic is so _simple_ to read,
        // but what was tricky was persuading myself to stop messing around with 
        // "if numbers[right] == 0 then peek at numbers [right+1]"
        // Instead, I had to stop and _tell the computer what to do_, not describe 
        // _how to do it_.
        for numZeroes > 1 {
            if numbers[left] == 0 {
                numZeroes--
            }

            left++
        }

        longestSequentialOnes = int(math.Max(float64(longestSequentialOnes), float64(right)-float64(left)+1))
    }

                    What would it take for managed grafana (quick to set up!) + managed kubernetes (also quick), 
                    plus Loki + promtail inside the cluster, but with all of the grafana -> Loki traffic happening
                    on the azure backbone? More effort than using the integrated monitoring for your managed cluster,
                    but ðŸ˜Ž cooler ðŸ˜Ž.

                    <p>
                    Grafana's docs are written towards their yaml configuration file. I'm installing this into a kubernetes cluster using
                    their helm chart. It's unclear from the docs what are the minimal required fields for the helm chart. If you get discouraged,
                    remember these things: (a) the docs <i>do exist</i> because people want you to be able to figure this out (b) figuring out
                    the helm chart configuration is <i>part of the puzzle</i>, part of the fun.
                </aside>

                    grant managed identity access created via script

                    configure storage account with right blobs https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/production/helm/loki/values.yaml#L312 in bicep
                </p>
                <p>
                    https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#azure_storage_config
                    It's fairly unclear what the docs are asking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    disable auth_enabled - https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/10873 - claims it was fixed in april. The fix was merged https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/12411
                    and is in 3.1.0. The current helm chart references 3.0.0 as the most recent version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All this to get an error. 

                    Refresh request failed. Status Code = '400'. Response body: {"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Multiple user assigned identities exist, please specify the clientId / resourceId of the identity in the token request"} Endpoint http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fplaytechniquelokilogs.blob.core.windows.net

                    Do we let this stop us? Do we fuck.

                <p>
                    Downloading the loki source code; makefile has a build target for loki-image, can override the destination of make with <code>IMAGE_PREFIX=playtechnique make loki-image</code>
                    Plan:
                    <li>
                        <ol>Build custom image with better logging or something</ol>
                    </li>
                    How do we figure out where Loki needs tweaking? Started by searching for 'azure storage multiple identities.' Found nice article https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/migrate-azure-credentials?tabs=roles-azure-portal%2Csign-in-azure-cli%2Cgo%2Cazure-portal-create%2Cazure-portal-associate%2Capp-service-identity%2Capp-service-connector%2Cassign-role-azure-portal
                    which says part way through that if I were writing a custom app in go (Loki's written in go) then <code>go get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity</code> and
                    <code>cred, err := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential(nil)</code> should look familiar.

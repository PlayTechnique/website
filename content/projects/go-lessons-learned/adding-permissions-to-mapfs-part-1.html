			I decided to try and commit to golang, because I was feeling brave.
                </p>
                <p>
			First step was identifying a github issue for a specific problem: The test.MapFS package does not
			enforce file permissions. I'd found this problem while working on Andrew, and John Arundel kindly
			identified <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50787">a github issue</a> tracking the 
			problem.
                </p>
		<p>
			"Hah", I thought, "This'll be easy."
		</p>
		<p>
			There's no hubris quite like the hubrjis of estimating while never having working on a problem like the one before you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Those wiser than me have noted that the moment of beginning is the moment of greatest ignorance.

			First I compiled golang. Then I figured out how to source that same build repeatedly. It turned out that 
			vs code was being weird about interacting with the custom build, so I had to add <code>"go.goroot": "/Users/gwyn/Developer/go/bin"</code>
			to settings.json
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, settings.json is global to all instances of vs code, so I have to either remember to turn
			it off or have mostly broken package imports in other projectsfor a few weeks.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also wrote a .env file to set up my command line environment
<pre><code>
; cat ./src/gwyn.env
PATH=/Users/gwyn/Developer/go/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

			It wouldn't be hard to automatically activate it when I enter into <code>~/Developer/go</code> but I'm manually sourcing it. I'm l a z y.

		    	I started with adding a test into <code>go/src/testing/fstest/mapfs_test.go</code>
<pre><code>
func TestMapFSFileSystemPermissions(t *testing.T) {
	m := MapFS{
		"path/to/a.txt": &MapFile{Mode: 0o000},
	}
	_, err := m.Open("path/to/a.txt") // Use Open instead of Stat
	want := fs.ErrPermission

	if !errors.Is(err, fs.ErrPermission) {
		t.Errorf("MapFS should not open a file with permissions 0o000 want:\n%s\ngot:\n%v\n", want, err)
	}
}

</pre></code>
		All I'm trying to achieve is trying to open a file without permissions and getting an error.
		</p>
		<p>
		So how do you check file system permissions anyway? Normally this'd be enforced by the kernel (the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open</a> system
		call returns an EACCES error if permission is denied, but a mapFS is just a hashmap that contains
			a bunch of a type called a <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.23.1:src/testing/fstest/mapfs.go;drc=b0b1d42db32a992150dd26681d3bda222e108303;l=16">MapFile</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The kernel source for open() shows that it mostly dumps the work to a second function, after checking for whether it needs a special type to represent the size of a big file.
			The kernel shows that it populates a struct tracking file permissions, but I can't quite <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/16f73eb02d7e1765ccab3d2018e0bd98eb93d973/fs/open.c#L1044">
				figure out from the kernel source</a> precisely what else is happening.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, I need to figure out how to verify if a string like "644" and validate it against a set of permissions. Fun!

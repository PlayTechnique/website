                <p>
                    grafanasink wants to track changes in the grafana sqlite database as they're being written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I see two options: an outside observer trying to track changes, by comparing them with a known
                    good data source, or sqlite somehow tracking inserts and updates itself.
                </p>

                <h2>Can Go Register A Callback?</h2>
                <p>
                    go-sqlite3 lets you <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#hdr-Connection_Hook">provide a callback function</a> when a database mutation happens. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It didn't work for my needs. Following the code is tricky as it crosses the C boundary, but any mutations happening outside of the current connection didn't trigger
                    the hook. The behaviour sounds like it wraps <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/update_hook.html">Sqlite's Update Hook</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This quote from the update_hook documentation seems fairly damning for this approach:
                    <blockquote>The sqlite3_update_hook() interface registers a callback function with the database connection identified by the first argument</blockquote>
                </p>

                <h2>Plan B: sqlite somehow tracking inserts and updates itself</h2>
                <aside>
                    <p>Minor confession: there was about 30 minutes of screwing around with <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/doclist.html">sqlite docs</a> before I got somewhere. I read how to (a) create a table, (b)
                    ask for table info, (c) create a trigger.</p>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    The truth is that I don't know much about sqlite, but the docs are pretty great and showed it shouldn't be bad to <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html">create a trigger</a>
                    that'll keep track of changes in the grafana database table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plan: start showing I know how to use a trigger. Then, see if the trigger can automatically insert some data from the original insert, so ultimately I can add a trigger to Grafana's sqlite db
                    that will track the name of an updated dashboard and the content of the update.
                </p>
                <h3>Start Simple</h3>
                <p>
                    <pre><code>
sqlite> CREATE TABLE inputs(input text);
sqlite> CREATE TABLE triggered(tracking text);
sqlite> CREATE TRIGGER inputtrigger AFTER INSERT ON inputs BEGIN INSERT INTO triggered VALUES("trig"); END;
sqlite> INSERT INTO inputs VALUES("hi friend");
sqlite> select * from triggered;
trig

                    </code></pre>
                </p>
                <h3>Insert Some Info From The Original Query</h3>
                <p>
                    I realised at this point that I'm building an audit table. Once I put the name to the concept I found <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/15/sqlite-history/">really good prior art</a>"
                    to guide me.
                </p>
                <p> The <i>mask</i> field in there isn't something I need while I'm toying around, but looks valuable for when I implement this against grafana itself.</p>
<pre><code>
sqlite> CREATE TABLE _inputs_history ( _rowid INTEGER, id INTEGER, input TEXT, _version INTEGER, _updated INTEGER);
sqlite> CREATE TRIGGER input_insert_history
   ...> AFTER INSERT ON inputs
   ...> BEGIN 
   ...> INSERT INTO _inputs_history(_rowid, id, input, _version, _updated) 
   ...> VALUES (new.rowid, new.id, new.input, 1, unixepoch('subsec'));
   ...> END;
sqlite> INSERT INTO inputs(input) VALUES("hi friend");
Parse error: no such column: new.id
</code></pre>
            <p>
                The first bug! I had thought I got a free ID column, but <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#the_primary_key">the Primary Key docs</a> show
                that I have to explicitly request one with the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> keywords.
            </p>
            <p>  I can't add a primary key after the fact to my inputs table; it's not supported. Time to delete and recreate:</p>
<pre><code>
sqlite> DROP TABLE inputs;
sqlite> CREATE TABLE inputs(
(x1...> id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
(x1...> input TEXT
(x1...> );
sqlite> INSERT INTO inputs(input) VALUES("hi friend");
sqlite> select * from _inputs_history;
//nothing here
</code></pre>
<p>Second learning, this one from the docs<quote>Triggers are automatically dropped when the table that they are associated with (the table-name table) is dropped.</quote></p>
<pre><code>
sqlite> CREATE TRIGGER input_insert_history AFTER INSERT ON inputs BEGIN INSERT INTO _inputs_history(_rowid, id, input, _version, _updated)  VALUES (new.rowid, new.id, new.input, 1, unixepoch('subsec')); END;
sqlite> INSERT INTO inputs(input) VALUES("hi friend");
sqlite> select * from _inputs_history;
2|2|hi friend|1|1728051238.601

                    Okay! Enough for the proof of concept stuff. I can move on to investigating the grafana db now. That'll be for next time in this project.

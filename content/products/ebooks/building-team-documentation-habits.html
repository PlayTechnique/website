                <h1>Building Team Documentation Habits</h1>
                <p>
                    The book contains the ideas I've seen work to build a whole team's documentation habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's no magic bullet here: you'll need to do some work. I'm not here to BS you, but to give you
                    a plan that works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also contains an overview of the kinds of documentation tools that exist on the market, and their
                    relative strengths and weaknesses. Some of you don't need that; some of you don't know what tools to
                    pick.
                </p>
                <h2>Excerpt</h2>
                <p>I'm a very pragmatic person. This is reflected in the book. </p>
                <p>Here's an example of the kinds of advice and ideas in the book:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h1>The Docs Need To Be Where People Will Look</h1>

                    <p>I had a colleague who called me into a meeting.

                    <p>He said he had called a meeting because he wanted to look at metrics, but didn't know how I had
                        set up grafana or how to get access.</p>

                    <p>"I wrote it down. It's all documented."</p>
                    <p>"Where?!? If nobody can find them, they're not useful."</p>
                    <p>"Have you looked?"</p>

                    <p>It's surprising how often people will ask you a question before they look to see if they can find
                        an answer themselves. <i>You have to be okay with guiding them.</i></p>

                    <p>I remember he started with our github organization's search, and he found the docs.</p>

                    <p>He did something next that you'll see on your own team. He tried to cover up being a little
                        embarrassed by trying to catch me out. He said, "Github isn't where we should store docs, what
                        if I'd started on the wiki?" </p>

                    <p>He searched the wiki and found a page I'd written there that contained a link back to the docs on
                        github. I put backlinks in every documentation system I could think of, so the docs were
                        discoverable anywhere people might think to look.</p>


                    <p><i>Docs need to be discoverable everywhere, to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible.</i></p>

                    <p>It's not an enormous burden but it's annoying and at times it's tiring. You can normally script
                        the process of adding links into several systems, which makes it easier. </p>

                    <p>Once your team has a habit of knowing where docs are, you can start only putting them in the
                        right place, but that isn't the right way to start.</p>

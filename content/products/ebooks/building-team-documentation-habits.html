                <h1>Building Team Documentation Habits</h1>
                <p>
                    The book contains the ideas I've seen work to build a whole team's documentation habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's no magic bullet here: you'll need to do some work. I'm not here to BS you, but to give you
                    a plan that works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also contains an overview of the kinds of documentation tools that exist on the market, and their
                    relative strengths and weaknesses. Some of you don't need that; some of you don't know what tools to
                    pick.
                </p>
                <h2>Excerpt</h2>
                <p>I'm a very pragmatic person. This is reflected in the book. </p>
                <p>Here's an example of the kinds of advice and ideas in the book:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h1>The Laws Of Team Documentation Inertia</h1>

                    <p>You can see from the first story above, and probably from your own experiences, that if the
                        person who is told to write the docs doesn’t value writing them, it won’t happen. From this
                        comes the first law: </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            People want the docs to already exist, not to write them.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>From the first story above, you can find the second and third laws, too. Nobody on our support
                        team wanted to read the starter doc I wrote, even though it gave them what they needed to make
                        progress: </p>
                    <ol start="2">
                        <li>People do not want to find the docs, they just want the answers from your docs.</li>
                        <li>People do not want to read the docs, they just want the answers from your docs.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>From the second story, you can see this:</p>

                    <ol start="4">
                        <li>Maintaining docs is more effort than you think.</li>
                    </ol>

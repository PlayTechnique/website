            <section id="introduction">
                <p>
                    This book, "Building Team Documentation Habits" is about how you can start changing
                    your team's culture around documentation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a working DevOps Engineer. The DevOps books tell us that we need to work on cultural shift as
                    much as technical change. The technical changes tend to be well-documented, but the cultural shifts?
                    Barely anyone talks about that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I decided to write a series of books about changing culture on your team while changing the
                    team's practices.

                    The book contains a plan for building documentation habits. There's 
                    no magic bullet here: you'll need to write docs to inspire docs. I'm not here to BS you, but to give you 
                    a plan that works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also contains an overview of the kinds of documentation tools that exist on the market, and their
                    relative strengths and weaknesses. Some of you don't need that; some of you don't know what tools to pick.

                <h2>Excerpt</h2>
                <p>I'm a very pragmatic person. This is reflected in the book. </p> 
                <p>Here's an example of the kinds of advice and ideas in the book:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h1>The Laws Of Team Documentation Inertia</h1>

<p>You can see from the first story above, and probably from your own experiences, that if the person who is told to write the docs doesn’t value writing them, it won’t happen. From this comes the first law: </p>       

<ol>
    <li>
People want the docs to already exist, not to write them.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>From the first story above, you can find the second and third laws, too. Nobody on our support team wanted to read the starter doc I wrote, even though it gave them what they needed to make progress: </p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>People do not want to find the docs, they just want the answers from your docs.</li>
    <li>People do not want to read the docs, they just want the answers from your docs.</li>
</ol>

<p>From the second story, you can see this:</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li>Maintaining docs is more effort than you think.</li>
</ol>

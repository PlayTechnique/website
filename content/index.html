     I'm Gwendolyn. I'm a DevOps engineer, a software engineer, and a problem solver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked with physicists, software startups and large corportations, helping mature software engineers with their infrastructure chores and teaching rocket engineers industry best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I prefer well known solutions: CI/CD, automation, observability and metrics. The trick isn't just building the tools, it's supporting their adoption too.

      I'd love to hear from you and help get you where you and your team need to be.

     I'm Gwendolyn, a DevOps engineer, a software engineer, and a problem solver. I help get deployments running in Government Cloud and commercial cloud, with a focus on SSO integration and repeatable deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus on well known solutions: repeatable CI/CD, toil automation, metrics and observability are the foundation of a stable system. If your deployments are manual, you should get in touch because I can help you.

      I want to help your busines move faster, and help your teams to feel more secure in their daily lives. <a href="/contact">Here's where I store my contact details.</a>

      Ongoing documentation of small projects is up in the blog. You won't see difficult solutions there, you'll see me reaching for simplicity.

        I'm Gwendolyn, a DevOps engineer, a software engineer, and a problem solver. I help get deployments running in
        Government Cloud and commercial cloud, with a focus on SSO integration and repeatable deployments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on well known solutions: repeatable CI/CD, toil automation, metrics and observability are the foundation
        of a stable system. If your deployments are manual, you should get in touch because I can help you.

        I want to help your business move faster, and help your teams to feel more secure in their daily work. <a

        I wrote a free e-book about how you, as a team member, can change the culture of your team from one that doesn't
        write things down to one that does.

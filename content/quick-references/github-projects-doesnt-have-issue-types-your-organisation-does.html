        <p>
          Let's say you want to add a new kind of Issue Type, like an Epic or a Story or other sort of well-known but not-default-in-projects kind of task. <i>That functionality is not in the Project</i>. Instead, head into your Organisation's settings, then Planning, then Issue Types.

        <h2>Why you won't find it in the docs</h2>
        <p>
          The only reference for what is in a Project's settings is clicking the settings menu item. Note that <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects">this page</a>, the index of the Projects docs, doesn't cover Settings. <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=github+projects+settings+documentation">Searching for Project Settings</a> only brings up Repository settings.

        <section id="reasoning">
          <p>
            Github may review Projects at some point and make its settings section comprehensive. It's hard to see how they do that, though, as an Issue in a Project can be assigned to a Repository, implying that a Repository has to have knowledge of  custom Issue types.

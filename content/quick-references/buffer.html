        <p>
          These images show each default view available for a new Github Project. The Table and Board dropdowns for settings both have "Fields", but Roadmap doesn't. Roadmaps still <i>have</i> fields, mind you; you can filter based upon them in the filter bar, for example, and there's a "Date Fields" button which lets you add a new Field that is the same thing as the first entry in the dropdowns for Table and Board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why the difference? I don't know, because the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project">Projects documentation</a> doesn't tell you anything about how the views are set up or thought about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish that Github wrote down why it's designed like this, because to me it's just darn confusing.

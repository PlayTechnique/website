                    <h1>Keep Going Till It's Fun</h1>
                    I was sitting here wondering how long I'll be adding features to <a href="/projects/andrew">Andrew</a>, and wondering
                    why I'm not writing more with it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's no real answer, obviously. With <a href=https://github.com/playtechnique/templ>templ (not the famous one)</a> 
                    I added the few features I really wanted (git integration, piping from the tool back into itself, the ability to list
                    what variables I should define) and it was obviously done at that point. Andrew's unfinished, though, and while it works
                    I don't really want to tackle the next two Big Features because they seem hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honestly, though, when I actually write a post here, Andrew's <i>fun</i> to use. I love that I'm writing HTML, not markdown
                    or some other intermediary form. It's a simple thing, but I adore it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why should I add more features? In my heart, I know <i>Andrew can be more fun to use</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always seen PlayTechnique, my budding little contracting biz, as a place for me to follow whimsy and have fun, not as
                    a <b>S</b>erious <b>V</b>enture. The thing that exhausts me at $DAYJOB is how <i>tiresome</i> it is coordinating work to
                    help improve the company. I love the work, I love the outcome, but gosh darn is it exhausting getting the projects right. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name <i>PlayTechnique</i> is literally about the idea that skills are fun to develop, and Play could be considered a skill,
                    just like handstands or parkour or lifting weights or writing stories. Improving my technique at my skills makes them more rewarding,
                    more enjoyable, <i>more fun</i>. Improving my technique at Play should be the same way; the more Play Techniques I have, the more fun 
                    it is to Play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how long should I be adding features for? Until Andrew is fun to use, that's how long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How long should you add new features to a github workflow? Until your chore is gone and now you're having fun in your project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How many tools does your Kubernetes cluster need? All of the ones that make it fun and enjoyable, and no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there's one manifesto I should write for PlayTechnique
